# IntroToVR_Course_CUBoulder
This repo includes projects that I have completed for the Intro To VR course at CU Boulder.
"Chitwood_Carnival_v2": For this Unity project, you will need to open the scene under assets -> ALL_Chitwood -> Scenes -> Carnival. Use left mouse click to move around and right mouse click to shoot during the games.
